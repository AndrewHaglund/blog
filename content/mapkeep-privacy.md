# MapKeep Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. The only data that leaves the app goes to iCloud for syncing, which is governed by Apple’s [iCloud privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/us-en/terms.html).

MapKeep accesses your device’s location to save and display items within the app. Access to this location data is handled by standard operating system privacy prompts.

Other than syncing with iCloud, no personal data leaves your device. Unless you email me for support, I have no information about you or the location data saved using the app.

– Andrew

**Business Transfers**
If MapKeep, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MapKeep goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As MapKeep does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)
