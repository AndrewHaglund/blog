Highlights from my time as a UX designer in the Technology and Innovation Network at John Deere.

## GrainTruckPlus

Photos of harvest season tend to depict perfect arrangements of combine harvesters plowing through fields in unison.

In reality it’s a logistics nightmare of combines, grain carts, semis, and long wait-times at grain elevators. All orchestrated by walkie-talkie.

The problem farmers face is knowing where all their vehicles are and which grain elevators are busy.

<!-- image --> {% image "./wireframe.jpg", "Wireframe diagrams of onboarding screens and core interactions of the app." %}

To solve this problem we built an app, a database of grain elevator locations, and a wait-time algorithm. With an iPhone or Android device in every vehicle we could provide farmers with real-time location information and crowdsourced wait-times at elevators.

Considering the stressful nature of harvest season, we designed an incredibly simple experience. The map shows nearby elevators colored and sorted using wait times. The Drivers tab lets you build your team by pairing with other users.

We met with customers throughout the development process to ensure we were focused on the right problems and got to test the app by riding along with customers in the cabs of semis and combines. The team I was on received an internal innovation award for the project for its unique infrastructure and simple design.

## GoApps

<!-- image --> {% image "./goapp.jpg", "Two screenshots of the same iPhone app, left is before iOS 7 and one is after." %}

I helped take photos, build content, and design the interface of our GoApp series of apps. It was a mobile-friendly, swipeable version of an Operator's Manual (the left UI in the photo) for accomplishing common maintenance tasks with your machine. There were maybe 8 or 10 of these for each product line: GoHaul (articulated dump trucks), GoCotton (cotton pickers), GoHarvest (combine harvesters), MowerPlus (residential lawn mowers), GoBale (balers), GoSpray, etc. I personally took many of the photos — including taking a trip to Germany, France, and the Netherlands to capture region-specific machines.

Around the release of iOS 7 release we did an update to the UI (shown right) which definitely "modernized" it, but looking back I feel the iOS 7 craze went overboard and removed a lot of the character of the app.

## Mobile Standards

<!-- image --> {% image "./mower.jpg", "Examples of 3 screens in a mowing app." %}

Before the modern “design system” moniker, I helped designed the design standards for John Deere mobile apps.

<!-- image --> {% image "./controls.jpg", "Example of a custom slider and native stepper buttons in an iOS app." %}

This covered elements like colors, controls, when to use default controls and when to deviate.

<!-- image --> {% image "./icons.jpg", "Examples of 26 John Deere app icons each with detailed illustrations of equipment on a gray horizon with the John Deere trademark below." %}

I illustrated several app icons (outlined in green) and maintained the guidelines for a growing collection of App Store icons.
