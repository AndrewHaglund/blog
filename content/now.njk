# Now
Last Updated September 23, 2024

- On parental leave from work until October and enjoying the fall weather in Urbana. (It’s gone by too fast.)
- Working on iOS 18 support for [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).
- Playing HD Twilight Princess on my [Odin 2 mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini) at night in bed. Damn this thing is nice.
- Love the new Bon Iver track [S P E Y S I D E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4u1yrpuRE&pp=ygUHYm9uaXZlcg%3D%3D). Rhyming *wood* and *would* is a baller move.
- Rewatching *30 Rock*.
- Almost done watching *[Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p)* on Apple TV.
- Watching *Penguin* and *Rings of Power*. Up Next: *Slow Horses* season 4.
- The [Boox Go 6](https://shop.boox.com/products/go6) arrived and it is a glorious size. I would say it’s akin to a US passport.
- The [Tulip](https://tulip.computer) appeared but haven’t played with it yet.
- Got the amazing [8bitDo in blue](https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-special-edition).
