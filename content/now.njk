# Now
Last Updated November 5, 2024

- 🇺🇸 Awaiting the results of the presidential election. I agree [with Federico](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/113430774177072882).
- Did OK with "no spend month" in October… *except* for the [Analogue 3D](https://www.analogue.co/3d).
- Tempted by the new [Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/).
- 🎧 Listening to [*Songs Of A Lost World*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/songs-of-a-lost-world/1768728131), the new album by The Cure.
- 📺 Looking forward to *The Penguin* finale. Loved *English Teacher* on FX.
- 🕹️ Paused on *Zelda Echoes of Wisdom* on Switch.
