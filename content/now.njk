# Now
Last Updated October 2, 2024

- Just ended my parental leave and getting back up to speed at work.
- Trying to do a ‚Äúno spend‚Äù month in October ü§û
- Added iOS 18 app icon support to [MapKeep](/blog/2024/mapkeep-icons/).
- Playing *Zelda Echoes of Wisdom* on Switch.
- Paused: playing *HD Twilight Princess* on my [Odin 2 mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini) at night in bed. Damn this thing is nice.
- Rewatching *30 Rock*.
- Almost done watching *[Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p)* on Apple TV.
- Watching *Penguin* and *Rings of Power*. Up Next: *Slow Horses* season 4.
- The [Boox Go 6](https://shop.boox.com/products/go6) arrived and it is a glorious size. I would say it‚Äôs akin to a US passport.
- The [Tulip](https://tulip.computer) appeared but haven‚Äôt played with it yet.
- Got the amazing [8bitDo in blue](https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-special-edition).
