- Playing HD Twilight Princess on my [Odin 2 mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini) at night in bed. Damn this thing is nice.
- Love the new Bon Iver track. Rhyming Wood and Would? Baller.
- Rewatching *30 Rock*.
- Stalled on *[Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p)* on Apple TV and now watching *Penguin* and *Rings of Power*. Up Next: *Slow Horses* season 4.
