# Now
Last Updated September 9, 2024

- On parental leave from work until October and enjoying the fall weather in Urbana.
- Completed a substantial update to [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) and a follow-up bug-fix update. Working on adding a tip jar, just in case people want to support my work.
- Listening to [*Don’t Forget Me*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-forget-me/1727422029) by Maggie Rogers, [*Forever*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever/1738100076) by Charly Bliss, and [*American Football*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-football-deluxe-edition/1651301990).
- Rewatching *30 Rock*.
- Watching *[Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p)* on Apple TV. Up Next: *Slow Horses* season 4.
- Playing *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD* on Steam Deck. Grateful for the [contrasty](https://crementif.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/) graphic pack which makes it feel more like the original.
- Waiting for the [Boox Go 6](https://shop.boox.com/products/go6) to arrive.
- The [Tulip](https://tulip.computer) appeared! I’ll start playing with this soon.
- Preordered the [Retroid Pocket 5](https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld). It’s a risk buying anything without the okie-dokie from [Russ](https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps) but I heard the [4](https://www.goretroid.com/collections/frontpage/products/retroid-pocket-4-handheld?variant=44488626962656) was great and the 5 has OLED and has improved ergonomics. Also YOLO.
- I might be buying too many gaming things and not playing enough games. (It’s a disease.)
