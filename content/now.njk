# Now
Last Updated September 2, 2024

- On parental leave from work until October and enjoying the fall weather in Urbana.
- Completed a substantial update to [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).
- Rewatching *30 Rock*.
- Watching *[Sunny](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/sunny/umc.cmc.7c5t9dde8dxoaxwyl5rkuw38p)* on Apple TV.
- Playing *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD* on Steam Deck. Grateful for the *contrasty* graphic pack which makes the Wii U version feel more like the original.
- Waiting for the [Boox Go 6](https://shop.boox.com/products/go6) and [Tulip](https://tulip.computer) to arrive at my door.
- Anticipating more details on [Retroidâ€™s](https://www.goretroid.com) upcoming Pocket mini and Retroid Pocket 5 ;-)
