# Hi, I’m Andrew

I live in Urbana, IL, and work as a UX lead at John Deere. I love to build furniture, play Nintendo, futz on the piano, and go on dog walks. I studied industrial design at the University of Illinois and previously worked at Flats or Spikes, Nutrien, and Agrible. Follow me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund) or [contact me](/contact) to say hello.

### Furniture

Before jumping into work, how about woodwork? I enjoy making furniture by hand, joined without screws or nails.
