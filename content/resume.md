# Résumé

While studying industrial design at the University of Illinois, I landed a couple UX internships and I loved the mix of design, business, art, technology, and collaborating with engineers. I worked at [John&nbsp;Deere](https://www.deere.com/en/) for a few years before leaving for [Agrible](https://nutrienagsolutions.com/agrible), an ag tech startup. A year later we were acquired by Nutrien and I spent nearly three years integrating our technology into the larger enterprise.

I shifted gears and started working for a health and fitness startup, [Flats or Spikes](https://www.flatsorspikes.com). Around that time, I began consulting and had a blast working with companies like [Sunbasket](https://sunbasket.com), [Vineify](https://vineify.com), and [WriterDuet](https://www.writerduet.com) to build their design systems.

Now I’m back with John&nbsp;Deere as a UX design lead. I get to work on projects relating to autonomous and electric vehicles and lots of fun stuff.
