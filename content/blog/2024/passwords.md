I’m looking forward to Apple’s dedicated [Passwords app](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175505/apple-password-app-passkey-manager-windows-mac-icloud). I rely on the current system _extensively_ but having it trapped in System Settings was never a great experience (especially its modal design for editing, which blocks you from accessing other areas of the app).

They still need to add a “secure documents” area for scans of legal things like driver’s licenses and passports. I _could_ throw these into a [secure note](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-features-in-the-notes-app-sec1782bcab1/web) but it’s much nicer having a single place for all “secrets”.

Hopefully this is the year I’ll finally say goodbye to [1Password 7](https://blog.1password.com/1password-7-for-mac-the-best-ever/). (You heard right. I have not _and will not_ touch [1Password 8](https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-the-story-so-far/), which dropped support for free iCloud-based vaults.) You may surprised to hear but it’s **no fun** juggling two password managers.

Shoutout to [Michael Tsai’s link collection](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/07/19/apple-passwords-app-in-sequoia-and-ios-18/). He’s a great follow.
