I heard Nvidia overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world today. Their insane growth has been driven by the need for GPUs to build data centers and models for companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.

What I find interesting is that the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei, [wrote an essay](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) where he stated that the next generation of AI will take somewhere around $100 billion to create. That’s a _lot_ of money and it’s difficult to see the path from iterating on LLMs to get to "intelligence". One very likely possibility is that companies like OpenAI run themselves into the ground chasing this fantasy.

All along the way, Nvidia will happily take their cash **today** selling GPUs who may go out in a burning blaze of glory burning the cash and energy to make the AI of **tomorrow**[^1]. Regardless on your feelings of AI[^2], you gotta hand it to Nvidia for leaning into this and being a critical ingredient for all these companies: they’ll be the one left holding the bag.
