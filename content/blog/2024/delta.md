> The best Gameboy is the one you have with you.

I have been having a blast playing _Pokémon Crystal_ (specifically the [Polished Crystal](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=373172) romhack) for the Gameboy Color, _Tetris_, and _Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story_ for the Nintendo DS with [Delta for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688). At the time of this post Delta **is still #1** in the App Store thanks to Apple’s sudden and inexplicable[^1] change of heart. It’s an incredible app that’s been in the works for a [long time](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta) by Riley Testut. You can support it on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane)..

I’ve been having fun making a [custom skin](https://noah978.gitbook.io/delta-docs/skins) for Gameboy Color to improve the screen size and ergonomics in landscape.[^2] I’ve been playing with the [Gamesir G8 controller](https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-g8-galileo) — which is great.[^3] Pokémon is fine with onscreen controls but a real controller is ideal for games like _Super Mario World_ and _Tetris_.

What makes retro gaming on iPhone so special is everything that makes the iPhone such a compelling product: great support for wireless headphones, great battery life, streaming to your TV with AirPlay, and game controller support. This entire ecosystem was just _dying_ to get emulation added to the mix. Federico and John covered this well on [MacStories Unwind](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macstories-unwind/id1510451759?i=1000653687197).[^4]

The past few years I’ve been following along with Russ at [Retro Game Corp](https://retrogamecorps.com/author/onionsaregross/) and have bought the [Miyoo Mini](https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/05/15/miyoo-mini-v2-guide/), a [couple](https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs) [Anbernics](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h), and even the [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket). I see now that I have a problem but I find comfort in knowing [Brendon Bigley](https://wavelengths.online/posts/on-cheap-handhelds-in-a-world-of-smartphone-emulation) (of [_Into the Aether_](https://intothecast.online/)) is in the same boat.

While these devices can be great uni-taskers with good physical controls, they all fall short of the iPhone when it comes to screen quality, staying charged, and **convenience**:

While waiting in line for coffee on Sunday I pulled out my iPhone and played a few Pokemon battles (thanks to turbo mode) and caught a Jigglypuff. There’s _no way_ I would have even thought to bring one of those other devices on this quick neighborhood outing. Combine that with auto-saving when putting the phone to sleep — it’s just so easy to dip in and out.

As photography nerds like to say: _the best camera is the one you have with you_. This has been proven with the smartphone and now we’re seeing it all over again with [Delta](https://faq.deltaemulator.com).

_The best Gameboy is the one you have with you._

[^1]: To anyone who says regulation and competition don’t work, exhibit A is Delta and Apple [changing the rules](https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream) after _16_ godforsaken years.

[^2]: It’s not ready to share but I will _definitely_ will. I know others will enjoy it.

[^3]: I bought a [magnetic monstrosity](https://www.amazon.com/Orzero-Controller-Compatible-Adjustable-Accessories/dp/B0CJCB2P11) for the PS5 controller. This thing is _heavy_ and pairing to Bluetooth (then remembering to power it off) is not fun. Pro: the magnet lets you rotate the phone to portrait mode for an _amazing_ DS experience (if you can get it balanced). I also tried the [Backbone](https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one-usb-c-playstation/) and thought it felt flimsy with too-small buttons and joysticks. I found it used for $40 and it was promptly returned.

[^4]: Also mentioned in the show: while 99% of people are excited about Delta there’s a small (and annoying) part of the discourse saying, “Android has had emulation forever, what’s the big deal?” Two things: (1) Delta itself is _so good_ and (2) as Merlin Mann would say, “it might as well be on Mars.”
