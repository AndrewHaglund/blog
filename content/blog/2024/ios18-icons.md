I’ve been busy with making a few substantial updates to MapKeep this summer so I avoided touching the betas. The main item on my todo list is supporting the new app icon tinting and I’m glad I waited. It’s great seeing what many apps have done, courtesy of the [App Icon chapter](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-18-the-macstories-review/3/) in Federico Viticci’s iOS 18 review. Now I have some fresh ideas and hope to release something in the next week or so.
