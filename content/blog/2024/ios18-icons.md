I’ve been busy with making a few substantial updates to MapKeep this summer so I avoided touching the betas. The main item on my todo list is supporting the new app icon tinting and I’m glad I waited. It’s great seeing what many apps have done, courtesy of the [App Icon chapter](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-18-the-macstories-review/3/) in Federico Viticci’s iOS 18 review. Now I have some fresh ideas and hope to release something in the next week or so.

*Update September 20, 2024:* After using iOS 18 more I've noticed how glaring apps look that don't support the new icon styles. It's not for me, at least not yet, but it shines a big light on apps that don't update. Some will translate just fine but more colorful icons like NetNewsWire and my own just get lazily darkened by 20%. iOS 13, when Dark Mode was introduced, was not **this** noticeable: now without even opening apps you can see which apps have done the work and which haven't.

I don't begrudge Apple with how they rolled this out, just an observation.
