title: The Difference is Abundantly Obvious: Suing Suno
description: Suno’s explanation is indefensible.

I don’t have a fully formed opinion on how much of what Suno’s tools are just traditional “remixing” or sampling but this sentiment expressed in [their blog post](https://suno.com/blog/future-of-music) as a response to their RIAA lawsuit is ridiculous:

> … like the kid writing their own rock songs after listening to the genre … learning is not infringing. It never has been, and it is not now.

It’s obvious what the difference is, right? One is a computer absorbing millions of songs and one is a **human**. Computers don’t have rights.

They also justify their actions by saying:

> We train our models on … music we can find on the open internet -- just as Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and even Apple's new Apple Intelligence train their models on the open internet.

Which is akin to a toddler saying, “the other kids are doing it, why am _I_ in trouble?”

I am not pro- Big Record Label. I want people to make music and I bet Suno’s tools are neat but these are kid-level logical arguments that don’t hold water. I look forward to seeing what happens next.
