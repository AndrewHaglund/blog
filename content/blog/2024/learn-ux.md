A [colleague](https://www.linkedin.com/in/designbyq) recently asked if I had book recommendations that cover the *philosophy of design*[^1] or books that gave me a leg-up when starting in UX design. This was a head-scratcher initially and I didn’t know where to begin. Right out of school I immersed myself in design — like someone moving to another country to learn a foreign language. This involved a lot of reading, podcasts, doing [freelance](https://www.neutraldesignstudio.com) and [pro-bono](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alzcare-labs) side projects, and visiting friends who worked in the Austin and San Francisco tech startup scenes.

I’ve let that slide in recent years[^2] but I figured I could share the books, podcasts, and videos that helped me along the way.

## Podcasts 
While the majority of these shows are now retired I consider them to be evergreen.

- [Design Matters](https://www.designmattersmedia.com) is about creative people from a wide array of disciplines.
- [High Resolution](https://www.highresolution.design) was a limited-run show where they interviewed design leaders.
- [Layout](https://layout.fm) was a good topical show that helped me feel connected to the broader design community.
- [Presentable](https://www.relay.fm/presentable) is a great set of interviews from design experts.

[^1]: As an example of “design philosophy” they recommended *[The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com)* by Frank Chimera.

[^2]: I have a backlog of design organization books by O’Reilly (graciously purchased by my employer): *Articulating Design Decisions*, *Discussing Design*, *Org Design for Design Orgs*, *Design Leadership*, and *UX Strategy*.

[^3]: At the time of this book being released (2018) I looked up to the culture DHH helped establish at [37signals](https://37signals.com) but since then he’s turned out to be a turd.
