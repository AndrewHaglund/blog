title: 2023andMe Year in Review
description: A year in review for 2023 and what I’m looking forward to next year.
date: 2024-01-03
---

## Preamble
My goal is to collect the stories and art I experienced in 2023 and sprinkle in some personal updates. Reflecting on the year was a fun process and I hope to turn this into an annual tradition.

## Tech Stories
There were a lot of disastrous tech stories this year but [23andMe’s data breach](https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/) has a special spot in my heart. When I think about the implications for how this data could be misused (off the dome: planting false evidence at a crime scene, the inevitability of nonconsensual cloning), I have a hard time racking my brain for data that’s more sensitive. Stories like this *should* remind us to be more thoughtful of what we put online. Based on what I see on LinkedIn (a so-called “professional” network), it seems society has quite ways to go.

Other stories that spring to mind are [GM’s bone-headed decision to drop CarPlay](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/gm-justifies-decision-to-ditch-apple-carplay-due-to-stability-issues/) and the spectacular bungled effort to [fire Sam Altman](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board). The world came *this close* to Microsoft hiring every employee from OpenAI.*

Speaking of close calls: [Adobe almost acquired Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/). I’m bummed for the Figma employees (who missed out on a big windfall) but this is probably for the best.

We also saw the [collapse of Twitter](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/31/elon-musks-x-fidelity-valuation-cut), which was bound to happen, but did anyone think it’d deteriorate this quickly? In its wake we saw the [meteoric launch of Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787453/meta-instagram-threads-100-million-users-milestone) and [Mastodon’s](https://joinmastodon.org/) slow-and-steady growth. I hope smaller services like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) are getting their day in the sun. In 2024 and beyond I’m ready for a [weirder internet](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/).

It’s for these reasons I’m starting a blog**. After years of posting to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewhaglund) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewhaglund/), it’s time to have a proper home on the web. I’ve settled on:
- Short, frequent posts on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haglund)
- Long, infrequent posts here ([subscribe via RSS](/feed/feed.xml))

## The Year of Development
I prefer [Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/150) over resolutions and while I didn’t plan a theme for 2023, reflecting on the past year helped a theme emerge retroactively: *the Year of Development*.

After the initial excitement of the [Vision Pro unveiling at WWDC](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/wwdc23-highlights/) I spent many summer nights and weekends learning SwiftUI and SwiftData. In September I launched my first app, [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833).

I also noodled around with making an app for Merlin Mann’s [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) and a packing/shopping list app based on Myke Hurley’s request in [Upgrade 489](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/489)). These projects are on-hold for now.

Weebly hosted my personal site for 10 years but I grew tired of its outdated editor and *godawful* blogging tools. I used this as an excuse to learn HTML/CSS and rebuilt my site from scratch. At the end of December the site was rebuilt again using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).

## Travel
I visited Des Moines, IA, for a week every quarter for “in-person week” at work. My brother happened to live there which meant we could get dinner downtown or watch an episode of *The Sopranos*. He moved to Chicago in November which is a reminder to always take advantage of opportunities to see family.

I went to Florida to visit sugar can growers in February. The area was still recovering from [Hurricane Ian](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-ian-fort-myers-beach-florida/index.html) and the destruction was awful. Fort Myers Beach was still on a boil order. The hotel had been underwater days before I checked-in. Before my flight I spent a few hours walking a beach and marveled at collapsed hotels, restaurants, and homes.

In May we went to Michigan for a high-school friend’s wedding. A week later we went to a cousin’s high school graduation in Denver and we hiked at [Mount Falcon Park](https://www.jeffco.us/1332/Mount-Falcon-Park).

As an annual tradition we spent a week with my in-laws in Madison, WI, in June visiting downtown, breweries, and the [UW Union Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/). In August we made a trip to Missouri for our niece’s 2nd birthday.

At the end of September a close friend and college roommate got married in the Virginia/DC area. We had great time reminiscing over our stupidity in college.

## Work
I continue to work for John Deere as a UX Lead and love it. I was recently promoted and my area of responsibly has grown and I now directly manage a few designers. I’m still adjusting to the new role and I’ll be reading *[The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins)* ASAP.

I’m fortunate to have such a [great mentor and manager](https://inkypixelsdesign.com). This was a tough year for layoffs across a lot of industries and don’t take my position for granted.

I try to stay connected with the University of Illinois and in March I gave a talk about the design process at the [Siebel Center of Design](https://designcenter.illinois.edu/).

## Games
I’m approaching the end of the main storyline in *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* and … what a masterpiece. *Mario Wonder* was a blast too! There were [so many amazing games this year](https://intothecast.transistor.fm/episodes/the-2023-game-of-the-year-spectacular) and I expect my [OLED Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/oled) can help expose me to more non-Nintendo games in 2024.

I’ve also been playing retro games:
- *Pokémon Red* ([Anniversary romhack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2362/)) and *Tetris* on my silver [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket).
- The [PC port](https://www.shipofharkinian.com) of *Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on the Mac.
- *Super Mario World*, of course.

This Christmas the [Genki dock](https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2) let my cousins and I (ranging from ages 12 to 32) play local co-op with 6-players in *Super Smash Bros*. Chaotic joy.

## Podcasts
I heard the podcast ad market was tough in 2023. Hosts would mention this occasionally and in some cases I noticed fewer (or zero) ads. I decided to open [my wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/card-sleeve-wallet?color=hazelnut&material=leather&size=default) and financially support the work I love:

- *[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)*: Exceptionally consistent. Gotta support John now that [he’s gone indie](https://hypercritical.co/2022/03/30/independence-day).
- *[Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online)*: I have a tremendous appreciation for the art of video game creation thanks to Brendon and Stephen.
- *[Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/)*: I’ve been listening to the internet’s Merlin Mann and the Long Winters’ John Roderick for a *long time*.
- *[Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)*: Myke and Jason’s segments on Apple and the entertainment industry keep me coming back week after week.

I loved [Sir McCartney’s show](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/mccartney-a-life-in-lyrics) where he tells the stories behind some *truly* killer songs.**

I listen to a lot of podcasts. In 2024 I want to reduce my intake or introduce more variety. It’s too easy for me to pop-in an AirPod and tune-in. I’m not giving myself enough time for silence.

## Music
Thanks to Apple Music’s awkward [Replay](https://replay.music.apple.com/) feature I have a list of most-listened music from 2023:

- *[the record](https://boygenius.lnk.to/therecord)* by boygenius
- *[GUTS](https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS)* by Olivia Rodrigo
- *[Fantasy](https://m83.lnk.to/fantasy)* by M83
- *[WE](https://af.lnk.to/_WEAW)* by Arcade Fire (2022)
- *[Multitudes](https://interscope.lnk.to/Multitudes)* by Feist
- *[Asphalt Meadows (Acoustic)](https://death-cab-for-cutie.lnk.to/AMAcoustic)* by Death Cab for Cutie
- *[The Land Is Hospitable and So Are We](https://mitski.lnk.to/TLIIASAW)* by Mitski
- *[Oppenheimer](https://music.apple.com/us/album/oppenheimer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1697599270)* by Ludwig Göransson
- *[Random Access Memories](https://daftpunk.lnk.to/RAM_Originals)* by Daft Punk (2013) is routinely played on Friday afternoons as work winds down. (I will **not** link to the drumless abomination.)

Other music highlights:
- I just dug into Peter Gabriel’s *[i/o](https://lnk.to/PG21)*. There are 3 mixes of the album which is fascinating. The acoustic guitar in the opening track *Panopticom* is special.
- Sufjan Stevens’ *[Javelin](https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin)* was lovely but I haven’t listened to it enough.
- I recorded a short composition called [*A Quiet Night*](https://soundcloud.com/andrewhaglund/a-quiet-night).
- As part of a Christmas gift I introduced my brother to some chords on the guitar.
- My hopes are high for Michael Stipe’s [first post-R.E.M. album](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/magazine/michael-stipe-solo-album.html) (I first heard it teased on [Smartless](https://www.smartless.com/episodes/episode/24585bee/michael-stipe)). I really enjoyed the [*Up* remaster](https://found.ee/rem-up25).

Live shows:
- [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.rodgab.com) at Krannert’s [Ellnora](https://krannertcenter.com/ellnora) festival. They’re gods. (Thanks to Señora Kooy, my high school Spanish teacher, who originally introduced me to this duo.)
- [Lauren Mayberry](https://laurenmayberry.co.uk) of Churches at the Rose Bowl. I missed seeing her opener, [Claud](https://toastmp3.bandcamp.com/album/supermodels) whose record is a gift to humanity.
- YouTube concerts don’t count but my brother was at a very similar show to [Bon Iver at Pitchfork](https://youtu.be/TolZh65YsmM?si=mGJnauI28TmKEXYv).

One last note: we all heard a new Beatles song this year. Its authenticity is a bit contentious but seeing [people singing *Now and Then* in Central Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzzcsKb8iLY&pp=ygUZbm93IGFuZCB0aGVuIGNlbnRyYWwgcGFyaw%3D%3D) is something. It’s hard to imagine this song hasn’t been around for 50 years.

## Books
I read [Expecting Better](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310896/expecting-better-by-emily-oster/) which is the *Freakonomics* of pregnancy.

30 seconds into Apple’s trailer for [*Silo*](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2023/06/apple-tv-renews-hit-world-building-drama-silo-for-season-two/) and I was hooked. Before the show aired I read the first book, *[Wool](https://hughhowey.com/books/wool/)*. I’m currently reading *[Shift](https://hughhowey.com/books/shift/)*, book 2 of 3. If you’re a fan of the show, read the books.

(I *think* I read more than this but I don’t have a good tracking system.)

*As Warner-Discovery’s renowned rerun ad-laden movie channel extravaganza TNT would say, “We Know Drama”.

**Obligatory “There are many like it, but this one is mine”.

***The ads are obnoxious. One ad repeats throughout the series has Malcom Gladwell reading (I kid you not) this banger ad-copy, “Apple Card: a credit card made by Apple.” Good gravy.
