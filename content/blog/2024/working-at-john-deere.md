My UX career started with an internship at [Cazoodle](https://www.cazoodle.com) (a now-defunct, as far as I can tell) startup in the University of Illinois Research Park. After a year or so I got the opportunity to intern at the John Deere Innovation Center in Champaign, where I worked on mobile apps and had a blast. I owe a lot to my then (and now) [boss](https://inkypixelsdesign.com/) for how my career has unfolded so far.

In 2017 I left John Deere to join a [startup](https://nutrienagsolutions.com/agrible) and followed that path for 5 years (a story for another time). I’ve been back at John Deere for about a year-and-a-half and it’s amazing how a company with such a long history has adapted and modernized in a few short years.

Yesterday a colleague shared a [corporate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I3z-3zAd_Y) about what it’s like working at John Deere. I think it rings true and echoes the reasons I returned to the company and love my job. Hopefully I don’t come off as a corporate shill, but I do sincerely think it’s a great place to build a career and make an impact.

I’m incredibly lucky.
