What a clown. Elon Musk [lays off most of the Supercharger team](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147402/tesla-supercharger-layoffs-stalled-ev-infrastructure-projects). To think firing people will improve their supercharger uptime is *ludicrous*.

One of Tesla’s key differentiators from traditional car companies is its charging network. If EVs are the future then we need *way more* chargers in the U.S. and sources tell me you usually need people to get stuff done.

Somebody needs to eject this guy from the driver‘s seat. Unfortunately Wall Street ks filled with sycophants who love a good layoff.
