I added a [now](/now) page to my site after seeing a few bloggers talking about it. I requested to be added to [Derek Sivers’](https://sive.rs/nowff) [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com) and we had a nice exchange over email.

It’s a great way to highlight the media I’m enjoying and projects I’m working on outside of my quarterly updates. It’s fun. If you have a site, I recommend trying it yourself.

Best part? Now I can link people to [my now page](/now) and avoid entire classes of human conversations. Efficient! ;-)
