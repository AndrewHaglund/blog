This *may* be the last post if you are following my [JSON](/feed/feed.json) feed. My true [XML](/feed/feed.xml) followers should be a-okay (according to a Micro.blog [help doc](https://help.micro.blog/t/redirects/70)). This is your one and only warning to join the light side, lest you miss my posts going forward. If this sounds like a spam message lingo trying to get you to act fast â€” well you caught me and it would seem your spidey senses are tuned in.

*Vaya con dios*. May we meet again!

PS: I jumped the gun and started posting to Micro.blog over the past few weeks so you may find some special *unread* treats in there.
