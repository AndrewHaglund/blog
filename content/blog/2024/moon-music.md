Despite Coldplay’s new album _Moon Music_ not coming out until Friday, I found a way to listen to it.

In a world where many people tune into endless playlists and mindless lo-fi music on YouTube, I’m an old school album guy. I love discovering new music but I can’t latch onto an artist without sinking my teeth into an album or an EP. The _album_ is a work of art: What is its mood? What does this collection of songs in this particular order say about the people who made it and the time in which it’s made?

One of the things I’ve always appreciated about Coldplay is their dedication to the album. It’s certain to be a commercially-driven strategy: the duration between albums, time spent on tour, and how long they drip and hype a new release is like clockwork. Each album is an era which its own unique art style, show, and through line.

That brings me to _Moon Music_ (which is Coldplay’s second collaboration with Max Martin and billed as a follow-up to _Music of the Spheres_) which has a semblance of continuity, hung together loosely with what I would call _spacey_ sounds and (like 99% of pop music) simple ideas about love.

Here are my thoughts after a first listen.

(Listen to this album with some good headphones, you’ll thank me later.)

It begins with a gorgeous intro, the titular _Moon Music_, from Jon Hopkins. To my knowledge it’s the first time he’s been credited as a “featuring…” on a Coldplay track (as opposed to being relegated to liner notes) but he’s worked with Coldplay as far back as 2008’s opening track on _Viva La Vida_. The opener here too is absolutely brilliant and I was completely lost in it.

_Feelslikeimfallinginlove_ has a strange combination of having energy — especially in the chorus — while being a slow, low-key rhythmic vibe. It was a solid choice for a lead single.

_We Pray_ is a more successful version of _Princess of China_ with Rihanna, or _Hymn for the Weekend_ with Beyoncé. I don’t know the artists featured but I enjoy how _different_ this song feels and it has definitely grown on me.

_Jupiter_ is an absolute joy that fills your heart with an upbeat message. Ya gotta love the acoustic guitar and cello.

_Good Feelings_ with Arya Starr is a funky good time with a stellar guitar riff halfway in. It sounds like it could have been on Daft Punk’s _Random Access Memories_ or on a Passion Pit record.

_Rainbow_ is filled with dreamy synths, ripping guitar, a beautiful piano interlude, and a spoken part (which I assume is found-audio?) that reminds me of M83’s _Hurry Up We’re Dreaming_.

_Iaam_ (“I Am a Mountain”) is like a throwback to _Glass of Water_ from 2009 but without the heart. The mix itself is hollow: tonally, lyrically, and energy. It stays at one level the whole time.

_Aeterna_ is a groovy tune my brother. I’m looking forward to hearing _many_ remixes that take this jam to full-on EDM music. Nice vocal outro too. (I think they played this live at Glastonbury and it looked like a rockin’ time.)

_All My Love_ is a classic, piano-centric Coldplay love song with a great string ensemble. It feels like this song has been in the air forever yet is somehow new. (Reminds me of their demo of _Wedding Bells_ many moons ago.) I wanna sit down at the piano and learn it.

_One World_ has vamping synths, piano, guitar which fall away to a hundred humming voices then trails to _another_ breathtaking string piece. Some Pink Floyd vibes at the very beginning then goes straight to M83 for its crescendo.

(The outro had me wondering if they forgot to come back and record the words — but there’s also something charming in its rawness.)

There’s a lot of variety in _Moon Music_ and a lot to like. Musically there are some **incredible** moments, especially in the more complex instrumental compositions. Lyrically it left me wanting with two too many songs rely on “la la la” as a chorus.

As a continuous listening experience, it moves nicely throughout but there’s an unevenness. (The incongruity from _We Pray_ to _Jupiter_ is a bit of whiplash.)

To be sure, there is some beautiful music here (if you like Coldplay) but time will tell if this is a good _album_ that stands out in the annals of time like _Viva la Vida_. Maybe by my tenth listen I can check back in.

My first listen was laying in bed with headphones and I’m looking forward to hearing it on my speakers tomorrow for a totally different listening experience.
