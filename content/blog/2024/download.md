The other weekend my wife and I watched the excellent *Killers of the Flower Moon* on Apple TV+. We opted to skip the theatrical and digital purchase windows despite loving [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193388249-killers-of-the-flower-moon) and Apple’s caginess around when *exactly* the film would debut on the streaming service.

Right off the bat the movie’s [soundtrack](https://soundtracks.lnk.to/killersofflower) by the [late Robbie Robertson](https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-robbie-robertson-soundtrack-for-new-martin-scorsese-movie-killers-of-the-flower-moon/) set the tone[^1] and pace. We were hooked. A few minutes in, however, we started noticing blocky pixels — the video stream oscillating between vivid 4K and 240p pixelated mush from minute to minute.

It was just how Marty intended.[^2]

I naively thought pausing would give it a chance to buffer and it’d be smooth sailing. As the stuttering continued I restarted the Apple TV, force quit the TV app, ran a speed test[^3] and yet the issue persisted. Then the stream *completely* failed and a panic set upon the room. Life happens pretty fast. You never know the next time you’ll have the time and disposition to watch a three hour movie. **It was now or never.**

I wondered if the problem was with *streaming* the movie so I opened the TV app on my iPhone, found the movie, and hit download. A minute later the download completed and I used AirPlay to put it on the TV. The rest of the movie went without a hitch[^4] and we enjoyed the riveting and heartbreaking story of the Osage killings.

It was less than ideal needing two Apple devices to watch an Apple-produced movie. This is because Apple TV+ in the TV app on the Apple TV hardware does not support **downloading** video. For inexplicable reasons this overpriced hockey puck comes in [2 storage tiers](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k) but you can’t actually *store* anything on it.

That said I can see why Apple might not want to implement this feature:

- Unlike an iPhone you’re unlikely to take an Apple TV with you on an airplane and need to load up on movies before takeoff.
- Then there’s the messiness of managing and removing downloaded media.
- I fear Apple is allergic of buttons.

Whether you have a slower than average network at home, intermittent server outages, or taking an Apple TV to a hotel or Airbnb TV with crappy Wi-Fi, there are scenarios that could make this feature worthwhile.

The most straightforward solution is offering a download button on the episode or movie detail view — just like on iOS and the Mac. (Maybe a long press on the Play button could expose a menu with this option.)

Another idea is treating download as a *fallback* to streaming. Maybe the OS could notice streaming quality is low and prompt the user with something like, “Download movie? This can take a few moments but should play without interruption afterwards.” Playback could resume from the same spot using the local file and get automatically offloaded 24 hours later.

I know offline downloading is not a glamorous feature but little touches like this could make the Apple TV a bit more forgiving in the real world.

[^1]: Parts of it remind me of the *Breaking Bad* theme music, but extended to cover a 3 hour movie. It’s an excellent listen on its own.

[^2]: Aside from the obvious financial benefits and prestige that come with a theatrical release, I’m sure directors like Scorsese get bummed out by the idea of someone watching their movie on a cramped phone screen or buffering through the first 15 minutes.

[^3]: Totally normal behavior when encountering the slightest delay of internet television.

[^4]: Except when the cable from my iPhone knocked my beer into the living room rug. Less than ideal.
