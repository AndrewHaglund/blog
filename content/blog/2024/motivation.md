I haven’t updated [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) in a while but I’ve been plugging away at a nice update. I’m *almost* done and I’m feeling motivated to keep pressing on.[^1]

Two things have motivated me to get back into the swing of things:

1. After making a couple tweaks and sending to TestFlight, my iPhone app would crash *every single time* I created a location in the Apple Watch version. Annoying!
2. My wife is due with our first kid in roughly 10 days. Whoo! I’ve heard a tiny rumor that kids can be time-consuming? It’d be great to get the update out the door before it goes back on the shelf.

Seeing that crash every day or seeing the calendar days slipping away gives me reeling feeling of:

> I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this…

One *could* call this motivation. Another less healthy term would be anxiety or obsession. I put a lot of pressure and false urgency on myself — it’s something I want to work on. The tough thing is that I enjoy the challenge and the act of making an iOS app but **everything in moderation**. I need to have balance and headspace for other more important things in my life.

[^1]: I’ll share more on what’s next for MapKeep soon. I don’t want to promise anything prematurely.
