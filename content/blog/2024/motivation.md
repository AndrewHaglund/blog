I haven’t updated [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) in a while but I’ve been plugging away at a nice update. I’m *almost* done and I’m feeling motivated to keep pressing on.[^1]

Two things urged me to get back into the swing of things:

1. After making a couple tweaks and sending to TestFlight, my iPhone app would crash *every single time* I created a location in the Apple Watch version. Annoying!
2. My wife is having our first kid in roughly… 10 days! I’ve heard a tiny rumor that kids can be time-consuming? It’d be great to get the update out the door before it goes back on the shelf.

One *could* call this motivation. Another less healthy term would be anxiety or obsession. I get this reeling feeling of:

> I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this…

 I put a lot of false urgency on myself — it’s something I need to work on. I love the challenge of making an iOS app but **everything in moderation**. I need to have balance and headspace for other more important things in my life.

[^1]: I’ll share more on what’s next for MapKeep soon! I don’t want to promise anything prematurely.
