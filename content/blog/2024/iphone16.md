Myke Hurley in [Upgrade 528](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/528) commenting on the densely packed iPhone event:

> We built these phones from the ground up for these new features and none are them are there on the day they go on sale. Really weird.

I think this exactly captures how strange and vague this whole presentation was. They didnâ€™t even bother announcing when 18.0 will release!
