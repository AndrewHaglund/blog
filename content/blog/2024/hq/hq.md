This past week I was lucky enough to visit the renowned John Deere Headquarters in Moline, IL. The buildings were designed by [Eero Saarinen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen) (known for his work on the St. Louis Arch) and landscaped by [Hideo Sasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Sasaki). My timing could not have been better with the weather and I was able to experience the area in all its winter glory. 

As you approach you see the [massive structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deere_%26_Company_World_Headquarters.jpg) perched on a hill with a road that winds around a pond. It’s an impressive sight that makes you think: damn, this must be a big company. (This trip in particular evoked the snowy cliffside temple from Nolan’s *Batman Begins*.)

## Nighttime

Various colorful displays are inside but not clearly identifiable. The groundis covered in snow, reflecting light from the windows." %}

There are several incredibly long hallways to get from the parking lot to the office spaces. Walking throughout the structure gave me *Severance* vibes, which coincidentally was filmed at another Saarinen creation: [Bell Works](https://bell.works/new-jersey/explore).

## Garden

A large glass ceiling allows light to fill the space. The garden has lush green plants and rocks enhancing the natural look. The architecture is modern with clean lines and open spaces allowing for visibility across levels." %}

Aside from its zen garden, pond, modular grid system, and mid-century design, the standout feature, to me, is the atrium filled with plants and basked in sunlight.

Leaving headquarters involves driving slowly through a hilly wooded area. There are moments where you can see the building but by-and-large you’re enveloped by trees. I couldn’t help but notice the physical transition going from work to life. You’re forced to drive through nature and leave behind the corporate edifice. As someone who works fully-remote, there was something nice about that.

I’m positive the designers intended all these beautiful and inspiring moments. It delivers.
