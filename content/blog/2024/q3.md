description: Life update for July, August, September 2024.

The past few months have flown by. Our kiddo is almost 5 months old now and I was lucky enough to spend September home with the family. We went to a wedding, a close friend’s wedding shower, the [World Dairy Expo](https://worlddairyexpo.com/) (grilled cheese and milkshakes, yes please) and snuck in a number of family visits.

I feel so fortunate to have a job that offers paid time-off. [John Deere went through layoffs](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2024/07/11/john-deere-layoffs-waterloo-iowa-job-cuts/74365649007/) and I was lucky enough to be spared. It reminds me that **no job is 100% secure**, even at big companies. I don’t take it for granted.

Other things of note:
- My grandma and her sister made a day trip to visit us back in July.
- We visited Columbia, MO, for our niece’s birthday.
- Traveled home for my brother’s 30th birthday party.
- Took so many pictures of our kid. It’s not even funny. (Thank goodness for [iCloud Shared Photo Library](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118229).)
- Listened to many hours of [_Roderick on the Line_](http://www.merlinmann.com/Roderick/) on our several road trips.
- Went axe throwing at a work event. Fun!
- Replaced the power lift gate on our RAV4 that was stuck shut. Not fun!

During the evenings when everyone went to bed:
- Worked on a big update to [MapKeep](/blog/2024/mapkeep-1-3) and a few [smaller updates](/blog/2024/mapkeep-icons/). It was great having some spare brain power to refactor the app after a year of stumbling through re-learning app development.
- Played _Zelda Twilight Princess_ on my newly arrived [Odin 2 mini](https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini) as I waited for _Zelda Echoes of Wisdom_ to arrive.
- Finished _Pokémon Crystal_.
- Added a [now](/now) page to this site where you can see what I’m up to outside of blog posts. I also upgraded this site to [Eleventy version 3](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/).
- Listened to new albums by [Maggie Rogers](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-forget-me/1727422029), [Charly Bliss](https://music.apple.com/us/album/forever/1738100076), [Clairo](https://music.apple.com/us/album/charm/1742301413) and discovered [American Football](https://music.apple.com/us/album/american-football-deluxe-edition/1651301990) after learning [their house](https://pitchfork.com/news/american-football-house-available-to-rent-on-airbnb/) is near me.

TV shows watched:
- [_The Acolyte_ (Star Wars)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479-the-acolyte) had so much potential. Interesting themes but strange pacing and seemingly low-budget at times (despite having a **massive** budget).
- [_30 Rock_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4608-30-rock) seasons 4 and 5.
- [_Penelope_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/241773-penelope) was outstanding and reminded me to savor nature. I heard about the show in an [episode of *The Town*](https://www.theringer.com/2024/9/25/24253629/how-to-make-your-own-tv-show-and-get-netflix-to-buy-it-mark-duplass-penelope-netflix) with Mark Duplass who self-funded the show.
- [Sunny](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/157226-sunny) had a great hook, absolute fantastic style, Rashida Jones, Japan, but felt a bit all over the place. It felt confused about who was doing what and for what reasons.

Started watching [_The Penguin_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/194764-the-penguin), [_Rings of Power_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/84773-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power) season 2, [_English Teacher_](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/258902-english-teacher) (_so_ funny), [Hacks](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/124101-hacks) (so _so_ so funny).
