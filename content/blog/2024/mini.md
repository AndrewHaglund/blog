Jason Snell [writing about the new Mac mini](https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-review-phenomenal-cosmic-power-itty-bitty-form-factor/) with M4 and M4 Pro, writing at Six Colors:

Jason Snell cracks me up.

I’m certainly tempted by the new Mac mini. I have a great desktop setup — two displays, continuity camera, great speakers — but the brains are a MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) in clamshell. It’s a great machine but you can always use faster when doing SwiftUI development.

I’d love a machine that’s always ready for me at the desk but my hangup is: do I really need two Macs? I feel like if I get the mini I need to trade in my laptop. There are times I want a Mac to-go though and Apple silicon MacBooks have almost zero compromises.

The correct decision is to _not buy anything_. We shall see.
