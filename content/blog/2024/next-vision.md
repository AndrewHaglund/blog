[M.G. Siegler tosses out a few interesting ideas](https://spyglass.org/apple-knew-where-the-puck-was-going-but-meta-skated-there/) for how Apple Vision Pro could be re-envisioned as accessory to the iPhone. Let the iPhone be the brains and the battery for headset and have _that_ be the tethered thing (instead of that jumbo battery).

The hole there is that ultra low-latency for passthrough mode is essential so people don’t get motion sick (and so you could play ping pong) while wearing it. Maybe that could have been solved to some degree, but I assume the physical proximity from silicon to display is a key factor.

Overall I like spitballing on “what if” scenarios for Apple Vision Pro successors and Siegler has some good points. I am intrigued by products like the [XREAL](https://www.xreal.com/us/) glasses for projecting my Switch or iPhone and less keen on an entire new computing platform.
