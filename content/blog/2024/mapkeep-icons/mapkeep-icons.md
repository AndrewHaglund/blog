Version 1.3.5 of [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) will hit the App Store shortly and adds support for dark and tinted app icons for iOS 18.

Thanks to Louie Mantia for his [dark mode app icons blog post](https://lmnt.me/blog/dark-mode-app-icons.html). He inspired me to use a sunset in the background (as opposed to Apple’s [default gradient](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#iOS-iPadOS)) which strikes a nice balance between fitting in and standing out.

I hadn’t touched the artwork for the app icon since 1.0 last summer so it was fun to get back in there and experiment with color and transparency for these new variants.
