I bought the [GameBaby](https://www.bitmolab.com/pages/gamebaby) immediately. I’ve been wanting something like this for a while: I *knew* USB-C + Delta on iPhone would lead to this inevitability.

I usually go case-less but it’s sacrifice I’m willing to make to turn my phone into a Pokémon machine.

(I wish it had 4 face buttons for SNES but hey, it’s $20.)
