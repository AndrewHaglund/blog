I’m a longtime “small phone proponent” and always chose the smallest iPhone available. I went from the iPhone 12 mini then to 13 mini[^1] and swore I’d hold onto it as long as possible. Of course, capitalist consumerism had plans of its own.

When the iPhone 15 Max Pro was announced with a [5× telephoto lens](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/apples-iphone-15-pro-max-goes-to-disneyland/) I knew I had to upgrade[^2]. Going from mini to Max was an adjustment but every time I punch-in and get the shot I’m reminded that I made the right choice. Today I got a picture of the baby with grandma, and I simply could not have captured it with my previous phone.

Here’s to you, iPhone 15 Pro Max. Here’s to you.

[^1]: I don’t usually get a new phone every year but after hearing rumors that the mini would be discontinued, I decided to go for the upgrade. The bigger battery, better camera, and (believe it or not) smaller notch were all selling points. Plus it came in [red](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-introduces-iphone-13-and-iphone-13-mini/).

[^2]: What put me over the edge: last fall we knew we were expecting so I _needed_ the best camera possible to capture the little one. Like I said: capitalism.
