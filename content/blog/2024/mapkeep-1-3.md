I launched an update to [MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833) this weekend which brings an all-new design. It has a list and map that stay in sync: selecting something on the map shows it in the list. Date filters are also improved. 

The previous design was all-map which made it nice to _view_ your collection but difficult to _explore_ your locations chronologically. The app has been out for almost a year now so I wanted to make sure it could handle large collections.
 
I debated calling this “Version 2.0” because it was effectively a **full rewrite** of the iPhone app and brought a substantially new experience. However, from a user’s standpoint: this basically just adds a list! So I’ll hold onto that for a bit longer.

I’m sure there’s something in your life that you’d like to track easily. So [check out MapKeep](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapkeep/id6467408833). (It’s free!)

For inspiration: here’s a couple real world examples of how it’s used:

- A friend of mine moved to a new city and they capture spots in town (parks, neighborhoods, restaurants) to come back to later.
- A family member wants to use it anytime they get a birdie on the golf course to mark the occasion.
- Tracking where your dog does a number 2 on walks ;-)
