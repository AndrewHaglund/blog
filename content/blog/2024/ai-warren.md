Can you believe this shit? As reported by [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/a-beloved-tech-blog-tuaw-is-now-publishing-ai-articles-under-the-names-of-its-old-human-staff/) the scumbags used a byline of a previous and _well-known_ writer, [Christina Warren](https://mastodon.social/@film_girl), for AI generated content.

> The real Christina Warren hasn't been writing these new posts on the zombie TUAW, however. The site's new owners have [stolen her identity, replaced her photo with an AI-generated one](https://www.tuaw.com/author/christina-warren/?ref=404media.co), and have been publishing what appear to be AI-generated articles under her byline.

The shitheads who bought TUAW have apparently already taken this down[^1] but oh my lord. The audacity of these people. Outrageous.

(This is shocking and appalling but it made me wonder if [AI could resurrect John Siracusa of yore](https://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/) to write a review for macOS Sequoia this fall. Obviously I would not want it to happen like this.)
